# LoL-Damage
a collection of reverse engineered data concerning damage interactions in League of Legends

This page is the source code repository.  [You might want to view the nice page here instead.](https://franktheboxmonster.github.io/LoL-Damage/)

**THIS SYSTEM IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.**  It does **NOT** claim to be perfect, **BUT** it should be pretty close.

This is all the result of human research.  We're usually pretty good, but with a couple hundred thousand unique interactions possible, there's always room for errors.

Sometimes things also get stealth changed, which can take a while to be found.  You should always test to confirm things before risking your ranked games.

If something seems missing, nonsensical, or wrong __***AND YOU CAN PROVE IT***__ then please submit an issue **[HERE](https://github.com/FrankTheBoxMonster/LoL-Damage/issues/new)** with details.
