**THIS SYSTEM IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.**  It does **NOT** claim to be perfect, **BUT** it should be pretty close.

This is all the result of human research.  We're usually pretty good, but there's always room for errors.  You should always test to confirm things before risking your ranked games.

If something seems missing, nonsensical, or wrong __***AND YOU CAN PROVE IT***__ then please submit an issue **[HERE](https://github.com/FrankTheBoxMonster/LoL-Damage/issues/new)** with details.
